# unpublished list

```dataview
list
from "2011-present Sweden"
where published != "Yes"
```
**2025-08-18** I got it working, from the clue given in the forum post. Put quotes around the string, and take care to spell it exactly right. Use "Not yet" If you want only unpublished, or != "Yes" if you want everything with a published status other than "Yes".
**2025-08-01** I got closer, but still had problems, so asked on the forum https://forum.obsidian.md/t/unexpected-dataview-query-results/103569.
**2025-07-29** I tried and failed to figure out dataview commands to get a list of blog posts I haven't published yet.
# ToDo
```dataview
task

# other searches
