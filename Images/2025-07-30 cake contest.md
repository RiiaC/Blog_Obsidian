- woke 05:00, did 30 min pilates, went back to sleep till 08:00
- got up, made a sign from the almond paste  with letters of chocolate sprinkels, saying "The 300g Anvil" to add to the base of the cake for tonight's contest.
- breakfast, pack lunch, get text message saying that I can start at 11:00 (same time as Keldor) today, the 10:00 start was when they thought I would be working in the long house, but now that I am down the hill by the forge, 11:00 is better, as most visitors take time to wander that far from the entrance.
- first "full day" Stone carving this year. A regular stream of visitors to chat with meant frequent breaks, of course. One the the most common questions I get is how long does it take to make such a pot. I reply that it os tough to estimate, as my job is both stone carving and talking to visitors, but I have worked on it at least three different weeks. Perhaps someone focusing on the carving could finish one on a week?
- Keldor was a little stressed today, as he thought he had brought his phone with him, but didn't have it when we arrived. He tried going home to check, but the house door was locked, and without the phone he couldn't send a message to learn the code for the key box. But he got the smithy set up and functioning and started working.
