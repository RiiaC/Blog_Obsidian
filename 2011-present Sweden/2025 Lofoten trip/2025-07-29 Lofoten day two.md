- woke up just after 08:00, but didn't manage to roll out of bed till almost 09:30
- still did my 30 minutes pilates workout before eating breakfast, packing lunch, changing to Viking clothes etc.
- arrived at the museum just before our shift started at 12:00. Checked the long house, my soapstone pot in progress was still there. Checked the barn, the pallet we had prepared yesterday to be delivered down the hill to our work station was still there.
- walked down the hill, no sign of anyone who might know anything. 
- Keldor walked back up the hill to fetch his axe and a few useful items
- while he was gone I ate my pastie. Then one of the guys working for drift drove by, so I chatted with him. He suggested I just call Elisabeth, so I did.
- a bit later she sent a message saying that stuff was in the way. 
- Keldor returned just before the pallet of stuff arrived, so we unloaded it, put the pallet in the little viking storage tent we put up yesterday, then put the boxes of metal bits for forging, and the bags of charcoal inside. We put the benches and my box of tools in my work area, and hid my sandals and our lunch bags inside. (I changed into my viking shoes after we arrived. I know they will eventually wear holes in the soles, but I would like to put that day off as long as possible, so I use my Borkenstocks for the 1 km walk down the hill)
- then we checked that it would be ok, and got out the tent that they discovered had gotten moldy and opened it up to make a large, oddly shaped, flat roof over the stack of syones that is the forge. 
- to do that he used his axe to cut poles with a forked ends. They worked very well.
- the anvil delivery happened directly after the pallet, and they said they would be back with the bellows and my soapstone. They were. At 16:30.
- the time between finishing the roof and getting that delivery went slowly. The time after went much faster, as I was both working on my stone carving and occasionally lending a hand as he worked on getting the bellows set up.
- when I started making this pot, I added a bit of a rim around the edge  to make it easier to hold and lift. However the museum bought a handle for the pot, so it can be suspended over a fire. In order to rivit that to the pot I have to take away that rim and make the top of the pot flat. Luckily, I hadn't finished the inside, so I have enough stone available to do this.
- our shift ended at 19:00, and we walked back up the hill to where we had parked the car, then stopped by the store on the way home, where we picked up cat sand (which he will use to get the smithy working tomorrow), yoghurt so I cam make naan bread, and baking paper to roll out the almond paste we had coloured last night.
- after a short break we went to work on our cake for tomorrow, the *300-gram anvil.*
- the anvil is cut from layers of pound cake wirh raspberry maremlade between, and covered with a bluish grey almond paste. It sits on a tree stump, also made from layers of pound cake and raspberry marmlade, but covered with brown almond paste, and with bark made from chocolate sprinkles. We also lay bits of green almond paste around the base of the tree stump.
- now it sits in the fridge and waits for tomorrow evening's cake decorating contest. The name? Because my pound cake calls for 1 pound each of butter, sugar  eggs, and flour, but i chose to use 300 grams of everything, as that is an even 5 eggs.
