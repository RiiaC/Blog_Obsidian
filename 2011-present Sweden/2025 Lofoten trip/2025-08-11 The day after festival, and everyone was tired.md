Stayed up too late posting a blog post, so it was 00:45 before heading to bed. Oops. Keldor slept pretty directly, but I didn't fall asleep, so I got up to do some yoga. In the process of reaching for my glssses case I bumped my index finger against the wall, the pad of which that (I forgot to mention in yesterday's post) had come briefly in contact with the edge of Keldorâ€™s very sharp axe yesterday, and so has a band-aid on it. Luckily, the damage is minor, and the blade sharp enough it didn't hurt at all when it happened. But it didn't like colliding with the wall in the dark.
So I took an Alvadon for the discomfort (I really do have pretty much zero pain tolerance, it is good that I am normally pain-free), did my yoga and tried again to sleep. This time it worked, and I got nearly 7.5 hours of very dream-filled sleep, most of which I don't recall, but the plots were mostly complicated and weird. I do remember driving a white car I couldn't get to go forward at an intersection, and then it slid backwards down a hill, curved off the road, and settled into a snowy ditch, so I got out  grabbed it by the slightly open hood, and pulled it back up out of the ditch onto the road. I remember being surprised it worked, and got in and started driving again, trying to make the left turn I had been trying for tje first time, but a big semi came up, got in front of/to the side of me and started turning right instead, pushing me the other direction. 
In hind sight, I think that portion of the dream was influenced by road noises outside the house. I have often had dreams about not being able to control a vehicle I am in when in a house right next to a road that has intermittent loud,  and kinda fast traffic, as the doppler effect sounds get incorporated in the dream. This usually, as today, leaves me feeling not as rested as I would like to feel upon waking. Of course that yesterday was an intense/fun day is also a contributor to my feeling tired today.

But I managed to get myself out of bed, did my morning pilates (ok, only 15 minutes, when it has more often been 30 minutes since we arrived in Lofoten), and we made it to work on time, where I didn't make as much progress on the pot as normal, due to lower energy than normal. It felt good to come home and curl up with a book after work. And when I finished that one, I bought another, and got sucked into conversation on the Alpennia Discord server. 

I should do yoga and go to sleep soon, it would be nice to have more energy tomorrow.
