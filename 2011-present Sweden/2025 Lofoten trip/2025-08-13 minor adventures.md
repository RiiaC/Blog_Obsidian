I woke up at 08:00, did a 45 minutes yoga session, had breakfast (yay for skyr! Which we bought while at the store last night. The plain version isn't available in Sweden, but I like it even better with my muesli than yoghurt) and then Keldor finally woke up.

We had also bought a package of frozen garlic bread yesterday, so we popped it into the oven to thaw/melt the butter while I cooked up the broccoli, zucchini and carrots with some chickpeas, almond meal, sesame seeds, and flaxseeds.

Then we went out for adventures. During the driving time I read aloud to him from **Skinsinger: Tales of the Kaltaoven**, which we are both enjoying (though it would also have been nice to look out the window).

Our first stop was near the beach at Vik. Last time we were both in Lofoten we had gone out that way, and stopped at a small parking pull out just on the far side of the sand beach and we walked down to the rocks, where he fished, and I looked at interesting geology. This time the parking pullout on that side of the beach were all full, so we turned back and took one on this side instead. From my perspective this was a much better location, as we had to walk down a hill covered in berry bushes to get to the rocks. Which is to say, he walked briskly down the hill, fishing rod in hand, and went straight to what he wanted to do, which was fishing. I wandered slowly down the hill, pausing here and there to eat crow berries, and blueberries, but there weren't manly along the path, so I drifted gradually leftwards, till I found berry bushes that had berries that hadn't already been eaten, and I settled happily in, eating blueberries till I had eaten all I could find in that area (I spent about a half an hour there, I think).

I took a photo of Keldor, way over there fishing, just before I found the dense berry patch.

and once I had eaten my fill I thought of heading over nearer to see if I could get a better photo, then sitting on a rock to do the sewing I had brought with me. However, soon after I started walking across the rocks, he came walking back towards me. Once we met up we started picking up seashell halves of the sort that are useful for holding paint when working on scrolls. We filled a pocket full, that can be sold or given away at events later, before returning to the car, about 45 minutes after we arrived.

Our next stop was the glass blowing place at Napp, since we enjoyed it last time. However, they must have been doing some sort of renovation or something, as the upstairs area was closed off. As a result, the few tables were in use, and the number of other visitors seemed overwhelming, so we didn't get the coffee he wanted, nor the snack I had considered, nd instead we drove down the road and parked at another pull out where we enjoyed fika in the car (it having started raining).

Then we checked the map, and saw that tjere is a whale museum at Nusfjord, in the other side of the island. So we started driving that direction. However, it turns out thay one may not drive through the fishing village to get to the museum, and we didn't feel for paying for parking to walk 750 meters to go see if the museum was even interesting, so we went on.

Not too long later we saw another interesting parking pull out, at BÃ¸osen, and, since the rain had pretty much stopped, we stopped to look at rocks (me)

and fish (him).

We drove a bit further, to Flakstad, and decided to turn around and wend our way north again, returning to the house at 17:30, about five hours after we had left. 

Then we had a light meal and watched the latest episode of Squire Talk, https://www.youtube.com/live/go2v2K_TYK4?si=EcdOGw-AiPRfrQxT a Drachenwald series of conversations about knightly virtues by a couple of Squires, and their guests. We usually watch this live by joining the zoom itself, as they are all friends of ours, but this time we had to catch it later.

All in all a nice relaxing day. Though I am selfishly just as glad he didn't catch any fish, so I could enjoy eating with him, rather than hiding in the other room to avoid smells as he cooked fish, as happened last time we were here.
