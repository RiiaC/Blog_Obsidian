- 30 min pilates
- breakfast with Keldor 
- drive to the store, buy a loaf pan for the cake contest, and some food
- pack lunch
- answer email from Jens, whom I met at the Soldier's Hut, cutting gras with a sythe, when I was out for a walk with Tania and Mike 
- drive to meet Elisabeth at 10:00 at the museum administration building.
- after dealing with paperwork, walk down the hill to the outdoor smithy area.
- see the hole in the ground where the old smithy used to be, think "if we put a tent over the top of that it would make a delightful place to do my stone carving this summer", then Elisabeth suggests doing exactly that.
- get one of the extra viking tents and set it up over the hole.

- set up one of the tiny viking tents by the smithy area, so there will be a dry place to hide the charcoal.
- started refurbishing the pile of stones that is the outdoor smithy
- went to to the barn and filled a pallet with tools and supplies we need them to drive down for us
- went to the long house at 17:00 to clock out for the day, passed the cauldron of soup just as they were about to throw away the leftovers. Volunteered to help eat the leftovers. They also gave us bread and thick cream to go with it.  Yum!
- visited with a few of the other craftspeople after clocking out 
- returned to the house to start baking (Keldor went fishing). Baked a pound cake for Wednesday's cake contest. (Will decorate tomorrow)
- while cake baked started a pot of soup
- wanted to add some mushroom powder, but we are out. So I turned down the heat under the soup, took the jar of dried mushrooms, powdered them, and put them back in the jar. The bits that fell on the counter under the process wound up in the soup.
- then I turned the heat back up to get the soup properly boiling, made the egg noodle dough and tossed them in, followed by butter and fresh broccli. 
- cleaned the kitchen and packed the soup into one plastic box, and the cake into another 
- did 30 minutes of yoga
- now it is time to post this and get some sleep
