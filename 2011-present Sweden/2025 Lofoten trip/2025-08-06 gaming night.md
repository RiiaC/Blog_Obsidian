Woke around 04:00, finished up and posted yesterday's post, then did 30 minutes pilates, with the boosts set to glute strength and aerobic, and really liked the workout. I didn't start the laundry, as the washing machine is om the upstairs bathroom  surrounded by the other bedrooms. 
Then I slept for four more hours (other than heading to the loo at 08:00, which was still too early to start laundry in a house where no one starts work before 10:00)
Since it was a day off for both of us, we walked up to the museum after breakfast, returned the cordless drill he had used to drill the rivit holes in the cauldron, bought him a tshirt, and me a cute little bowl in a good size for a songle serving of nuts, chatted with a handful of our coworkers, picked up the two stringless bows that we'd seen in storage the first dat, and got som heavy linen thread/cord that he will ply into bow strings for them. 
Then we walked back home and I baked a quick plain cake with strawberry jam in it, and we headed off to visit Sandra and Stian, whom I met when I was here last year.
She is originally from Poland, and we are kindred spirits in many ways, ranging from colour preferences, to game playing philosophy. He is also delightful. We chatted, ate snacks and played games.
Settlers of Catan, Polish version works, because you can go by the image to tell what kind of development card it is.  I went first, which meant I got the best property, and, since we did random locations for the numbers, I wound up winning, by multiple points.

Then we played a game called Alias, wherein your teammate(s) have to guess a word you describe. It is in English, so as the only native speaker in the room I had an advantage, but we all had a lot of fun.

Now I need to do my yoga and get some sleep, as we work tomorrow, starting at 10:45.
