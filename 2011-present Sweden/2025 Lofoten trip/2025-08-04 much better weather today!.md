Went to bed at a reasonable time, slept till 08:30, meaning almost 10 housrs of sleep! (Not counting going to the toilet a few times, and taking my morning vitamins for the study.) Woke thinking of another way that might work to cut a bliaut out of the purple and blue silk fabrics I bought at Cudgel. 
But, of course, before sitting down with the computer and drawing program to confirm that it would work, I did my morning pilates, as I like not waking up in the night with sore hips, and the best way to keep doing this is enough of the right sort of movement.
I did try playing with the drawing program after, but it mostly convinced me that the chunk of blue really is a little too small for this morning's idea, and I will probably go with the plan I came up with last time I had the program open.
Since we don't start till noon today,  we even had time to run to the local store before work, so now I have frozen berries and a few other things I wanted.
Today's temperature was much nicer than yesterday, and it even rained occasionally. 
Therefore I made some progress on the pot. I am fixing the problem with the outside curve. When I removed the rim and grove just under the rim, so we will be able to rivit on the handel, the sides became somewhat pumpkin like in their curvature. Now I am trying to straighten out the upper walls of the pot, so it looks like the surviving artefacts https://vikingar.historiska.se/object_details.php?object=21F214B2-6727-4F0C-BD91-160EBA391CC7&e=&l=en in part because trying to make the inside curve to make the walls uniformly 1 cm thick sounds harder if I don't. 
Rod, the other Blacksmith arrived today. It is good to see him again. We will join him and his travelling companion for dinner tomorrow after work. I will just need to try not to eat during the second half of the day, to make it possible to be hungry thst late. Sleeping in may also help, which, given our work schedule here, is doable.
As we were driving home today we saw one of our colleagues walking down the street carrying a big bag of empty cans and bottles to return to the store for their deposits, so we gave her a ride. It is a couple blocks out of the way, but I wouldn't have wanted to carry that bag that far.
In other news, I am really loving the program Obsidian. I fell for it for the graph showing connections between notes, and I love that it is open-source, but the "daily note" feature has really made a difference in my posting regularly. Especially as I added a template with properties, so I can open the note in the morning, set the property "published" = "not yet", and add to it here and there during the day, then post later in the day, changing its published status to "yes".
Now I want to find an easy way to download all of my old Dreamwidth posts, and import them into Obsidian, preferably with tags and timestamps intact.
