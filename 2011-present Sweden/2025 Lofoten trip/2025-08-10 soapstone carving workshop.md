Finally lay down to sleep 00:40. Woke at 06:00 and thought that I should get up and take my vitamins for The Swedish Glaucoma Nicotinamide Trial (SGNT) https://sgnt.se/ . I have no idea if I just fell right back to sleep after thinking that, or if I mnaged to go to the loo on autopilot and then fell asleep again, but either way  the next thing I knew it was after 07:00 and I hadn't taken them, so I got up and did that, and went back to sleep till Keldor’s alarm ernt off at 08:20. (Since the vitamins need to be taken with food, and my interest in food hadn'tyet awakend,  I did what I often do, broke off a single bite of a bananaand ate tgat with the vitamins. That is small enough to manage when not hungry.)

For reasons neither of us understand, today Keldor was scheduled to work from 10:45 to 18:15, but I was scheduled to work from 11:30 to 18:30, with my soapstone carving workshop to begin at 12:00. (Normally we start and end at the same time, but yesterday, when he had the children's forge workshop he was supposed to atart 15 minutes before me and end 15 minutes after.) However, both yesterday and today we clocked in and out at the same time (and we started 15 minutes before we were scheduled to start).

Drift did deliver the box of large soapstone pieces and the large soapstone bowl full of small soapstone pieces on time, and Ole-Andreas found me the bowl full of knives and the laminated printouts Elisabeth had made from the pdf of small soapstone artefact photos I had prepared.

At exactly 12:00 no one was present, but soon after some people started dropping by and carving started. I supplemented the museum's knives with some of my personal tools, of which the various files proved the most popular.

I took photos of most (but absoutly not everyone) of the people and their finished projects, and just counted. 21 people! Most of whom did small things like spindle whorls or necklaces, but there were a couple of oil lamps. Eight of these were festival participants in Viking clothing, six were children in modern cloths, and seven were adults in modern clothes. At least one more adult finished a piece,showed it to me and left before I thiught about asking if I could take photos, and I am pretty certain a handful of other children participated without showing me a finished product.

One of my stone carvers, Filomena, went to the forge after she was done carving, and got Keldor’s help to make herself a cloak clasp. This, plus talking with folk after, meant that we stayed on site till after 21:00. A long, but fun, work day!
