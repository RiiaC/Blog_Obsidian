I woke 06:00, did 30 minutes Pilates, went back to sleep for another 1.5 hrs, after which I had a lovely, leisurely breakfast with Þora and Keldor.

We took off for adventures just after 10:00, and soon stopped at a second hand store, where Keldor found a large enough tea mug  (there are none in his preferred size at the house we are staying at, and I found a couple of wooden boxes in a good size to take lunch with me while working at the museum (since we had forgot mine in Sweden).  Then he found an electric planing machine for 100 kr). Their cafe had just baked cinnamon rolls, so of course we got some of them, too!
Our next stop was Nyksund, which is located at 69 N, 15 E.

It is a cute little fishing village that had become a ghost town in the 1970s, had a failed few attempts to resurrect it over the years, but didn't really wake back up till fairly recently, and is now a tourist destination.

After a quick walk through the village we stopped at a restaurant for lunch. A cute place that clearly does double duty as a pub at different times of the day.  I ordered the tomato carrot soup with bread and butter, which was ok, but nothing to write home about. Þora had the fish and chips, after double checking that the fish is locally caught and breaded and fried on site. She seemed quite happy with it. Keldor had the goulash of the day, which the server first said contained fish (which is why I didn't order it, but he did), but a very short time later the server was back to say that it wasn't fish today, but rather whale. He said that was fine. Þora commented to me that I should try some, as whale is red meat, not fish. However, they eat fish, so even if one doesn't consider them "people", if one doesn't like the taste of fish, I strongly suspect that one isn't likelyto like something that eats fish. Keldor, however, said that the goulash was very good. He offered me a spoonful of just broth, I smelled it, and it didn't smell like anything I would enjoy, so I didn't taste it.

After lunch we started walking back through the village and saw that the second hand store, which had been closed the first time we passed it, was now open. They must do a fair few trips elsewhere to get stock, I can't imagine that such a small and isolated community can generate that much in the way of antique and old stuff. Keldor saw a cute little cast iron cannon, perhaps 30 cm long, with no price marked, and at the same time I noticed a thin purple shawl with swirly yellow etc paisley like patterns that felt like it might be wool, that also had no price marked. So we asked. The guy said he didn't know, but then decided on 650 kr for the cannon and 70 kr for the shawl. So we left the cannon there, and Þhora took the shawl.

From there we walked down the street, and saw that the ice cream place, which had also been closed before lunch was also now open. What amazing ice cream! They drop frozen berries plus vanilla ice cream into an extrusion blender thingie. The sign advertised raspberry, blueberry, and black currant. I couldn't decide, as I love all three, but chose the black currant as I have never had it as an ice cream before. I thought I had to choose, as I assumed that the flavours were pre-mixed. Nope! Then I saw them drop the berries in the thingie with the ice cream, and regretted not asking for all three types of berries, which I think would have been even better. Oh well, I will just have to go back someday. 

As Keldor had a gass of a beer with lunch I had to drive home, which was mostly fine, and occasionally scary, because narrow mountain roads, sometimes under construction, plus traffic. 

We paused just over half way at a place we had spotted (and marked on the map) on the way north so that he could do some fishing, and I could do a bit of yoga. Then I just leaned back on the mattress I had carried down to the rocks to make yoga more comfortable, and enjoyed the view whilst typing up this, though posting had to wait till we got back to the house and onto the computer, so I could look up a URL for photos to include.
