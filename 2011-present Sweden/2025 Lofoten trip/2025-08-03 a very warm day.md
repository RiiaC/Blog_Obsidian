I woke 04:00 because my hip was aching, so I did 35 minutes pilates,  took a hot shower, and went back to sleep for another three hours. 
Once I finally got up, I baked a dozen bread pockets so I will have easy to take with food for a couple of days. I made the dough from the liquid in a box of chickpeas, some yoghurt, a dash of salt and enough flour to make a soft dough. The filling contains the chickpeas themselves, a box of crushed tomatoes, some dried kale, some mushroom powder and beetroot powder, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds, flax seeds, almond meal, and some artichoke hearts, plus spices. They are yummy!
The house was still a nice temperature when it was time to get ready for work, so I didn't think about my short-sleeved tunic. This would have been a good choice for such a hot, sunny day. Luckily, my work corner is shady and thus much nicer than out in the sun. Luckily we have a hose, and I could regularly soak my clothing, which helped. Even so, I wasn't as productive as I probably would have been under reasonable temperatures. 
Keldor, who is more tolerant of the heat than I am, was much more productive, getting the patch for the iron cauldron ready to attach and making (or finishing up previously started) a variety of small forged items. 
But by about 16:00 the sun had worked its way around far enough as to shine directly under his sunshade and onto where he was working. As he isn't stupid, he decided that was an excellent time to head up the hill with various metal things that needed grinding and polishing so he could do that in the shade, using power tools.
I stayed in my shady corner and kinda made a little more progress carving, but after about an hour with no visitors stopping by I packed away my stuff,  wet down my tunic again, and walked up the hill. After checking in with him, I continued up the hill to the long house, and ckocked us out there, about five minutes earlier that our shift was to end.
We tried swinging by the store on the way home, but today is Sunday (we had bith forgotten), and very few shops in Norway are open on Sundays. So no bags of frozen fruit for me today, darn it!
Instead I took a cool shower and washed my hair, then hand washed the linen tunic I had been wearing today (stone carving in a wet tunic = a tunic that turns the wash water black four times before rinsing reasonably clear).
Then I mended his tunic and wahed it too. Since he uses it at the forge I didnâ€™t even try to take it to clear wash water, but stopped after the fourth sink full if water, figuring that would solve the problem with the smell, anyway.
Now I will turn the filling that didn't go into the bread pockets this morning into a soup. By the time that is done I can do yoga and see if the bedroom is a sleepable temperature.
