Woke at 06:30 took my morning vitamin, and realised that, for the first time since starting the study, I forgot to take my yesterday afternoon vitamins.  Oops. Then I went back to sleep till 08:15, because that seemed sensible. 

It took a while thereafter to convince myself to actually get up, which meant that I needed to do only a 15 minutes pilates so that I would also have time to eat breakfast and pack lunch before heading to work. 

Since today was the first day of the Viking festival we had more visitors than normal. It also rained off and on all day, which meant people taking shelter under my tent roof, so I had a variety of interesting conversations. 

I managed almost as much carving today as yesterday, so there will be at least one more day needed to finish the outside of the pot before I resume the interior carving. But tomorrow is our day off, so Saturday is my next chance. 

After work we went up to the longhouse, where Archaeologist Rebeca Franco Valle gave a talk on Viking Art styles  leading us around the building to look at each of the styles we have represented, pointing out their diagnostic features, and letting us know which time periods apply to each. We have art in the Oseberg, Jelling, Mammem, Ringerike, and Urnes styles (but not the Borre style).

After the lecture we returned to the house where Keldor, tired after an intense day at the smithy, relaxed on the couch with his phone and some cheese puffs.

I started a bread sponge for tomorrow and compiled some photos of soapstone spindle whorls, fish hooks and line sinkers, and casting molds, and sent them to Elisabeth to be printed before Sunday's soapstone carving workshop.

Then I did my yoga and had a shower and am ready to sleep. Tomorrow we have the day off, so I will bake and we will head to the festival to check it out.
