Reached the Bessešjohka rest area just before midnight, we crawled into bed in the back of the van, and got a few hours sleep. I woke at 05:10 with an ache in hips, so I used the toilet and drove two hours, while Keldor slept in the passenger seat. Then he took over driving at the Lappeasuando rest area and I got a 40 minutes nap, till we came to the Stenbro rest area, where I did 15 minutes yoga under the bridge.

Then we drove on towards David's house, stopping for a sign in the Kalix area that said "blueberries". So I bought a 5 liter wooden box of blueberries gor 450 kr, which is a lot, but I don't have time to pick them, my day is already packed full.

David was home when we arrived, so I was able to get a hug and use the loo before heading down to pick black currants. Keldor lay down on the bed in the van to rest while I picked. After about a 40 minutes I was closing in on 3/4 of a bucket of berries, happily sticking to the bushes in the shade. Then he came down, talking on the phone with his dad, and grabbed me and dragged me over to bushes in the sun which had more, larger, berries. I wimpered a little, because sun, and we filled the rest of the bucket in about 15 minutes, and continued driving.

We dropped off a little gift (a glass testube thingie with a coiled base that we found in the second han store in Norway) for Louise in her mailbox on our way out of town (she had a doctor appointment), and picked up one she left for us (a bag of pretty rocks).

When we passed through Skellefteå we stopped to pick up my new passport. Luckily, the station is very near the highway, so very little extra time needed.

Then home and unload the car. I got all of the kitchen stuff put away and washed the dirty clothes we'd brought home while Keldor dealt with getting the basement stuff put away and mowing the front yard. That leaves the clean costumes and accessories to deal with later.

While driving we saw:

1 deer crossing the road up ahead, while I drove
2 reindeer, one of which majestic and white, with a huge rack of antlers
