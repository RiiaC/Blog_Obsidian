We started the day with loading the car eith everything save food and clothes to change in to after the after work shower. 

Then we went to work and packed up the smithy, took down the tents we had been using, loaded everything onto pallets for Drift to take away tomorrow, and our personal gear into out car.

Then we spent the last couple of hours of the shift up at the longhouse, where I made a small n√•lbinded bag.

Then back to the house, shower,  load the food into the ice chest and into the car, clean the room, and hit the road at 18:00.

We drove just till midnight, and got some sleep at a rest area.
