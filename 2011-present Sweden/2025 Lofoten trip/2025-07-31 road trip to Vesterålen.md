- woke at 07:30, did half an hour of Pilates
- got out my computer for the first time since arriving. This meant I was able to go back an finally post a back-dated blogpost which I had started typing on the day, got interrupted, and never finished ([[2025-06-22 home improvements and a delightful visit]]). 
- then we went out on adventures north to Vester책len, the islands just north of Lofoten to visit my friend 횧ora. 
- what a beautiful drive!
- once we arrived we made a yummy lentil curry for dinner, then she took us on a drive around the island, showing us the old family farm, where the farm's boathouse used to be, before a storm took it away, and proved to us that there isn't anywhere on the island that doesn't have an amazing view. Beautiful. 100% could live here, if I had a way to support myself.
- did my evening yoga at 23:13, and was in bed just before midnight
