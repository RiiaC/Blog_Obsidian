This morning started, as is typical for us on a work day, with his 05:00 alarm. By 05:30 he was on the road to work, as we chatted on the phone, and I was packing my backpack and getting ready to walk to the busstop. 

By 06:20 I was on the bus, but I didn't start work for another 10 or 15 minutes  as Brooke was on the bus, so we chatted for the first bit. I hadn't expected to see her again as the school year is over, but she was heading in to make up an exam she'd missed. I enjoy her company, but she is probably going to get a student apartment in town in the autumn, so our paths are unlikely to cross again.

I got a fair bit of work done in the morning, and then walked over to the hospital for my next check up as one of the lab rats in the Swedish Glaucoma Nicotinamide Trial.

While I felt wide awake when I arrived, the test where you stare at the light in the middle and press a button whenever you see another light blink into esistance anywhere else got me feeling sleepy. For the right eye I found my focus slipping repeatedly, but managed to force it back. Then, on the left eye, I actually fell asleep and woke back up immediately a couple of times.

Therefore I wasn't surprised when she said i had done worse on the left than in previous visits. Therefore, i will return om Monday to do that test again, and se if there is a real change.

I finished up there in a good time to catch the 12:30 bus home,  so I did, with the plan to both work on the bus, and more when I got home, to make up for the time missed at the eye doc's.

But as I waited for the bus I called Keldor, who was having a slow workday, waiting for parts to arrive so he can resume the current project. 

While waiting he came home and picked up the old freezer we are getting rid of, now that we have the better one from his dad. Since he wasn't working, I failed on my attempt to work on the bus, and we hung out chatting till my bus got to Ånäset, where I hopped off and met him, and we went to the Stenfors Antique and second hand store, where we bought lots of things. Hand woven bands, bentwood boxes, wooden bucket style lunchbox with lid, a medieval style saw, a felt sun hat, a mad scientist lightbulb lamp, some Asterix comic books, a bunny, and a large wooden box suitable for carrying large scrolls.

Home after that fun date I baked some naan bread, and we ate the entire batch. Yum! Then he went out and mowed the lawn, while I sat down and resumed my work day.

As we have a workshop on monday, where we will be demonstrating how to filter and export data from the SEAD database, I have started working on a tutorial video for it. 

So far it is only the introduction part, explaining the goal of the video, and introducing the various parts of the browser window, but I am pretty happy with it, as I was able to figure out how to zoom in to each portion of the screen as I described it.

I have already done the screen capture for the data filtering part of the video, but adding the voice over to that, and adjusting the timing so that the words and mouse action align can wait till tomorrow. 

 After putting down the computer I tucked Keldor into bed, then did my yoga and relaxed carching up in social media a little before sewing a cord to my new hat, so it won't blow off in the wind. 

Then I crawled into bed and decided to write this. Now it is after midnight, and tomorrow is atill a work day, after which we drive to Luleå for Spelmansstämman in Gammelstad, so I should post this and get some sleep.
