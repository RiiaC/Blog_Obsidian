 ...coincided with an unexpected change in the bus schedule. 

The earliest bus to head to Umeå from Lövånger has departed at 06:30 for at least as long as I have needed to take that bus (so, at least six months). For most of thst time I have checked the bus app multiple times before leaving the house, to confirm departure time, and checkthe map that shows where the bus is at that moment,  and thus calculate the optimal time to leave the house.

On Monday,  which was the first day of my new job, I didn't check the app, but just did some things that needed doing around the house to fill the time between Keldor leaving for work, and time to depart myself. I took the electric scooter, and left in plenty of time to get to the stop and have time to fold it up before I expected the bus to get there.

However, as I was rolling down the hill towards the bus stop, I saw first one bus, and then the other pullout of the parking lot and depart.

I didn't wait to see which was northbound, and which southbound, I just turned around and went home, thinking I could get the car and catch up with the bus as it leaves Ånäset. 

I got back to the house ay 06:25, or five minutes earlier than (I thought)  the bus had been expected (and it takes 5 minutes to get to the busstop from here on the scooter, so I would have been 10 minutes early, if not for the fact that now the bus leaves at 06:20.

I started driving, and just as I turned onto the highway I saw another northbound bus. That it came so soon after the other prompted me to turn around and go park at the busstop and check the app for the next bus. Due in 20 minutes. Gets to Umeå by 09:00. First meeting at 10:00. That will do.

Monday and Tuesday I went to the office, had meetings, met people, did reading, had lunch with colleagues etc. Wednesday I had no meetings, but a pile of stuf that I need to read, so I worked from home.

Thursday my car had an appointment with the shop, so we dropped it off on Wednesday evening, with the plan for me to pick it up on my way home from work (the shop being very near the bus stop in Ånäset). I had no appointments on Thursday, just thought it would be good to spend time on site, and perhaps see colleagues. 

Thursday morning I went to lock the door as I left the house (having consulted with the app to confirm where the bus was, and when it was expected), but my keys were not on their lanyard in the pocket of my phone baldric, where they always are

Keldor, on the phone with me, said "I have them". He reminded me that when I took his car key off of the ring it shares with my car key, so I could leave my car key with the workshop,  I handed him it, and the rest of my keys, so he could add it to the other key ring, as I filled in the form to leave with the key. When he finished that, he put my keys on the dash of his car for me to pick up, but I never noticed them, and never thought of them again till I needed them the next morning. Wht should I? I never set them down anywhere,  I only hook them to the loop in that pocket directly, onthe rare occasion they are unhooked.

Since I didn't have my office key I decided to just work from home.this worked so well, I forgot to join the Archaeology seminar over zoom. Which is a shame, as not only was I looking forward to it, it also would have been my first zoom after getting the SoundConnect to pipe computer sound to my hearing aids. But while I remember setting an alarm for it, I don't remember it going off.

The shop called in the afternoon to say that they needed to order stuff, so they will kerp the car till next week. So I just took the bus to town for fighter practice , but left my armour at home, and we did unarmoured practice. Fun though.

Today I had a meeting, so went in to the office, had a good meeting,  learned that they don't expect me to be able to do much beyong learning between now and summer. 

I think I will like this job.
