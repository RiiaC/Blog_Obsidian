 We drove all night, and reached the Realm of Krake at 06:30. His guest house is wonderful, a small cottage with a loft, so we let ourselves in, put our beddong on the mattresses provided, and went straight to sleep.   
  
We woke at 10:30  had a lovely breakfast with Krake and Cia, and got the tour of their [workshop for their business](https://clurigt.se/)  and then got on the road at noon. That gave us six hours to make the 5 hour drive to site.  
  
During the drive I accepted a job offer as a project assistant in the Archaeology department of Umeå, helping researchers get their data into the SEAD database etc. I will start 1 May, and look forward to it!  
  
I got the call as we were walking down a dirt road, trying to get within sight of a runestone. Alas, the field it was on the far side of was huge, and there was a very deep, water filled ditch we would have had to have crossed to get to the field. None of wanted wet feet. So we have photos from 300 or 400 meters away, and it doesn't look like much.   
  
The next two runestones were much more satisfying. [One, Vg56, is a horned man](https://runkartan.se/runristningar/runsten-kallby-hallar-vg56-l1962-7447-kallby-23-2-i-gotene-vastra-gotaland.html#gsc.tab=0) , with what we saw as "en stor kuk, lång, kraftig och tung" (to quote the song) but the web page describes as "Thor with the belt of strength? [We took a photo,](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/15TnPAzMv6/) what do you think,?  
  
Now we are just about to site, not quite an hour after it opened.

Runestone v56, is described on the web page as possibily being Thor with his belt of strength. We see a horned man with a "stor kuk, lång, kraftig tung" (to quote the song we sang as soon as we saw it). What do you see?
