I saw a post on FB from a friend in Norway suggesting that people with a PhD and an interest in Cultural Heritage should apply for a job as a Researcher in Administrative Archaeology with The Arctic University Museum  Tromso. My first reaction was to worried aloud in the comments that my degrees may not count as “equivalent”, and my friend promptly encouraged me to apply, so I did. The same day, no less! I figured that the worst that could happen is that I would at least get the practice with archaeology applications, and see to it that my CV is up to date! To accomplish this I needed to update my personal information and jobs at JobbNorge, so now the next job I see in Norway will be a little easier to apply for.

We also applied for a summer job at the Lofotr Viking Museum, because I just plain love it there.
