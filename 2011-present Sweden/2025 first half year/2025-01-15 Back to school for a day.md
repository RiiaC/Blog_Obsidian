Tuesday I opted to leave the house early with Keldor and ride with him 15 minutes the wrong direction before he dropped me at a bus stop on the highway about 4 minutes before the bus arrived. (We would not have attempted this if I didn't have the app that shows the bus location.) Then I worked as normal on the bus and at work (including putting up the posters I made for the Open Science Umeå  Community linch meeting next week, which took about an hour wandering all over campus looking for bulliten boards).

Then I worked on the bus, continuing padt home and in to Bureå, where I met Keldor and we continued in to the city to help our friend K. move. We were 6 or seven people with two vans, a station wagon, and a trailer do it went pretty fast. Our van did only two trips before everything was at the new place. K. had been living in a basement apartment, and the new place is one end of a beautiful old timber farm house from the 1600's. The rest of the building is occupied by the owners. The view from the living room and upstairs bedroom is the Skellefte river, and rising out of of the trees across the river is the old city church dome, which dates to the 1800's. The whole effect is really pretty.

On the way home we stopped for groceries, and ran into Urban, one of teachers from Folkhögskolan last year, who teaches Samhällskunskap. We invited him to the Reengarda 30-year Anniversary event this spring, and I wondered if his class was still on Wednesdays, as I would be working from home.

It is, so today I took a couple hour break and joined them for class. He invited me back next week, when the school is paying to take the few remaining students to lunch to brainstorm ideas for recruiting more students. I would love to join them, but next Wednesday is a meeting I can't miss.
