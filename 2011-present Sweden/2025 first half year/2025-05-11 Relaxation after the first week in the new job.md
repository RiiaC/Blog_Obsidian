I deliberately made no plans for Saturday, as I figured I needed to let my brain rest after a week of learning about my new job.

We had a lazy morning, and played a quick game of Qwirkle, then around 11:00 Keldor dragged me outside to look to see if there were any flowers growing. When Kali saw us heading out she made it clear that she wanted to go, too, so we put her leash on, and we enjoyed the beautiful day. We brought the new bench he'd made before our Anniversary event out into the sun, so that the coat of linseed oil and tar he painted on it after the event would harden up a bit more before we take it to Double Wars. Then we hung the tarp over the kitchen window to keep it from getting too warm therein. Then some pelk work. Then he disappeared into the house to work on some projects he is doing for others that he wants to give them at Double Wars. 

Then I decided to pick back up the task we started last autumn, removing the row of bushes that grow along the edge of the house. While a previous owner clearly liked them I prefer not having them to direct water closer to the basement walls.

I made a couple of hours progress on that, and then went in for lunch, followed by time curled up on the couch with a book. Then I was inspired to go back out and resume digging out roots and then laying a row of curbstones against the edge of the house.

It is easier to do this than I remember it being last autumn, possibly because the bushes are only just starting to send out new spring growth, and the soil is kinda powdery. 

Today we went into town for crafts afternoon,  but I managed to leave on the kitchen table the paper we  printed that needs signatures to get me access to the shire bank account. Oops.

From there we went to the shire storage with Þórólfr to find and pick up the shire pavilion and sunshade etc. that we will bring to Double Wars. We dropped that off st his place and loaded it into the trailer, so that part is ready. We also stopped by the store to buy more of the black paint for painting the window frames and sills now that it is nearly warm enough to resume that project again.

After we got home there was some time on the couch with a book, but then it was so pretty I wnt back out and got in another 1.5 hours of digging up roots and placed another couple of curb stones against the house. I thought I would be able to finish the east wall,  but that last bit by the corner must have been where the bush started. Those roots were way thicker, more numerous, and very densly interlaced. So that last half meter will have to wait.

Now I really need to do my yoga and get to bed, tomorrow I resume learning about the SEAD database.
