Because I have that interview on Monday, of course I am browsing the webpages of the various labs associated with the position, and looking up the people who will be interviewing me.

Since this job is with the Archaeology division of the Humanities faculty, most of what I have been reading is archaeological in nature. However, one of the System Developers working on the SweDigArch project is also involved in a project Ibhad never heard of, called SweDeb. It took a little poking to figure that one out. The name seems to be an abbreviation for "Sweden Debates", and is assiociated with a database of transcriptions of all of the speaches made my the members of the Swedish parliment since 1867  https://riksdagsdebatter.se/public/index.html#/. Not only can people read and download the speaches, one can search the database for a word or phrase and get a timeline graph of how often it has been used, when. Or one can pull a set number of words before or after your word (or phrase) of interest, to see context. 

I had no idea that such tools exist, and it seems interesting, so I am sharing, although it probably wouldn't be interesting if you can't sspeak Swedish.
