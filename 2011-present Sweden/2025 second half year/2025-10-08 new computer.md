Today after work was a shopping day. Keldor's dad asked him to buy him a new computer, as the old one was giving warning notes from Microsoft about being too old to upgrade anymore. Keldor and I had the same problem, and we felt like it was time to throw money at it. They only use the computer to browse the web, watch stuff, and do zoom calls. So Keldor bought them both chrome books. I need a computer for a bit more than than that, so I knew that I would wind up spending a bit more than they did. Then I made the mistake of looking at the models with a touch screen. I had never used one before. Oops. Now I have a computer with a touch screen. I can even fold the monitor completely around and use it like a piece of paper to draw. Yes, I tested this, even before installing Obsidian, which I can't live without anymore.

However, it came with Windows 11, and I am not convinced I like it, and wonder if I should just have Þórólfr replace that with a better operating system before I copy over all of my files? 

After we picked up the computers we went to the hardware store and bought some *vindpapp* (no idea what the English word might be), which will be used for step one in insulating one end of the attic to make us a new, upstairs, bedroom. Apparently we first will first put up some boards with 60 cm spacing (so that insulation will fit nicely later), then staple the *vindpapp* to enclose the potential room on one side of the beams between the central portion of the attic (which is tall enough to stand up in), and the lower side bits to the side. Once that is done we can go back and buy insulation, then cover that with more *vindpapp*, then we can add the walls.
