Woke early, thinking that there is really only one problem with the inside-out cut pieces, the angle of the cut of the waist seam. So if I take the pannel intended to be the back purple skirt and make it the front I can simply trim the waist down to the matching slope. Likewise, if i use the one that was cut to be a front purple as a back, i can just piece in a triangle to be the waist, and, if I use a wrap belt, that seam won't even show.
Tried to go back to sleep, and realised that I should:
- [ ] create a folder list inventory of my old computer, with metadata, probably i  my house inventory Obsidian 
- [ ] that inventory should be a synced vault
- [ ] i need to back up way more than just documents from the old computer before making the the transition 
Smithy, made a knife and a belt hanging loop.

Games night. 
Me, Keldor, Clara, Þórólfr, Gilbert, Odal, and Caspian. 
Albion Protects Royalty. Clara won, which given that she only just met most of the group today, is pretty impressive. 
Carcassonne, first game i tried claiming a field, and it got cut off from all cities, and I lost. I learned from this mistake. Second game I claimed a field that already had two completed cities, and I won.
