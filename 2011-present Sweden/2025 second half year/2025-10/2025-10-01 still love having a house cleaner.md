Today I dropped the Academic terms Swedish class, mostly because I felt I have too much work to do to spare the time, and partly because it didn't feel like it was giving me much info I didn't already have.

My housekeeper came today, I still love having the house cleaned while I am working!

I made a first camping bed extender:
   - Cut up old couch cushions
   - Covered them with fabric from shipping bags of the new couch, tubes sewed a 64 cm wide rectangle into a 2 meter long tube, stuffed with couch cushion bits.
   
Once the second is done we will put one on each side of the single matress to make it double wide for events. This extender is about as thick as the gap to the wall in the van when the single mattress is added to the bed frame there, so it should work to bring them standing against the wall
