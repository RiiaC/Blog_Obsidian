My first meeting of the day was at the hospital for my regular eye checkup as part of the [Swedish Glaucoma Nicotinamide Trial (SGNT)](https://www.sgnt.se/). That was scheduled for 08:00. As I arrived at the busstop the app let me know that my bus had been cancelled. Next bus in an hour. Since it is a 15 minute walk home, I decided to just sit down inside the station and work there, as getting an hour of work done while I wait sounded better than not working for half an hour, and having only 30 minutes to do something. 

After I was on the bus it was late enough for them to be there, I called and let them know that I would be late, but was on my way. They were sympathetic and understanding. I arrived at 08:30, and we finished up the exam at 09:25. Alas, that is also the time that the bus departs from the hospital.  Next one not till 10:15. Sigh.

So I sat down in the bus waiting room and tried to accomplish something as I waited. I hadn't brought a full day of food with me, as I had planned to return home on that early bus.

When it was time to head out to the bus I realised that my poor eyes, which had had drops to dilate the pupils,  were too light sensitive to cope with the day, and I gave up trying to work on the bus.

As soon as I got home I went back to bed, as a good place to have my eyes closed, and slept for an hour and a half.

Got up, took lunch to the computer, and discovered that I was supposed to be in a zoom meeting I had forgotten about oops! 

Sent a note to the organiser with an apology and explanation, and got back an immediate "we are just wrapping up" note.

Then I faffed around for a while doing small useful organising tasks that will make life easier, but don't actually progress my work projects. Then Keldor got home from work, and I chatted briefly with him till he went to relax in a bath (after a day of wearing chainmail at work for extra training), and I finally found the right mindset to actually start working. 

By the time I put the computer down I had put in an 11 hour work day, despite having missed 4 hours out of my normal working hours. I hope I don't make a habit of this  but it felt good to finally be making real progress on this first data mapping project, after months of learning things I need to know to do this part of the job.
