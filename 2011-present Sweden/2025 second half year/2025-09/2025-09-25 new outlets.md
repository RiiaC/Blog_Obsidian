I worked from home this morning, and needed a nap around lunchtime. Almost woke after what may have been a short time, but as I wondered if I should get up,  the cand came an lay down on my hip, and I fell straight back to sleep. Finally woke for real nratly 1.5 hours after I lay down, but then just scrolled on FB for an hour, when the doorbell rang. (good thing I  had slept dressed, so i could hop up and answerthe door directly. 

It was the electrician, who had said last week that they would try to find time to drop by late this week. It was facinating to watch them work, I had never seen wires drawn through a wall before, so it was intto see the steps.

1. They set a sensor in the outlet, which sang a song of power flowing through the wires, till one of them went to the basement to remove the correct fuse.
2. The took off the old, single, plug from the outlet on  tthe wall by the food prep counter and drilled a hile into the lining of the space behind the plug 
3.
