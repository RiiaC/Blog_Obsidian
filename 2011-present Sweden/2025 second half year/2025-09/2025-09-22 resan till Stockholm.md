Today was the day for my first work trip for this job. I suspect they will become a reasonably normal thing in the long run, but I have had only one flight since the pandemic, so it still seems strange, and bothersome. 

Part of the reason I started the silk sewing project this weekend was so that I would have a small travel project. I looked last night for my little flying scissors, the ones one buys in a pharmacy for cutting baby fingernails, with the rounded ends. Couldn't find them. Decided I would just buy a new pair at the pharmacy at the hospital this morning on the way to work. 

Did that, no problem. Shoved it into my lunch cooler bag for the walk to my office. Didn't think of it again till on the flight. I presume it is still in that bag, in my office, with the ice clamps one can't take on the flight when flying carry-on.  Oops. At least I have my nail clippers, so I could cut thread on the flight. It worked.

The other oops was my poor tube of toothpaste,  which was nearly empty. Alas, the person working security must have stock in a toothpaste manufacturering company, as they confascated it and threw it away because the tube could have held more than the limit for flying. However, first they let me squirt some of the contents into my zip lock bag in which I had the toiletries for travel. So I can at least brush my teeth while I am in Stockholm without the bother of going toothpaste shopping.  

The flight was delayed taking off, but since we had no connection flights or time commitments before tomorrow, I didn't worry about it, and happily made progress on my sewing. This tunic is going to be lovely. 

There were three of us on this flight. P., our fearless leader, R., one of the database system developers, and I, and all staying at the same hotel. So we took the train to the city and walked together to the hotel, and, after we checked in and left bags in our respective room we went to Barrels Burger & Beer so they could get dinner (burgers) and a beer. I had water, and made sewing progress. It was a very pleasant evening. 

I made it back to the hotel in time to call Keldor before he went to sleep  and have company for my evening yoga. Now I have had a shower and am ready to sleep.
