Today at work I used AI to help me write code, and it worked, and I accomplished what I was trying to do. I don't think I am likely to have social conversations with AI any time soon, but programming help from a program? That makes sense. 

This evening we finly took the couple of large jars of dried mushrooms (*goliatmusseron*, also called matsutake, and *karljohanssvamp*, which google says is called penny bun)
and ) and ran them through the food processor to make 2 liters of mushroom powder. That should last a while, even though we put it in most things we cook. Luckily, it is mushroom season, so Keldor is often out collecting them on the way home from work.
