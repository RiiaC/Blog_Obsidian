Smithy day at Grundet with Keldor, Joni, and Oscar. They transformed some of Joni's bloom to metal bars, I started working on the Skellefteåyxa soapstone mould.
We went for pizza after, and I managed to eat two pices of artichoke asparagus pizza despite the late hour (which meant still eating less for the day than is typical)
