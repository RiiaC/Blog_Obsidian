A long work day today, as normal for Tuesdays, as our weekly meeting for the database team is at 15:00. We ended early enough thst I got the 16:15 bus home, which meant an 11 hour work day, since, of course, worked on the bus.

Keldor stayed after work and did some car maintenance, removing rust, adding anti rust layer, spackel and paint to many of the problem areas. There is more to do, but it is looking better, and I really appreciate him!

Then I tidied up a bit, and washed the pillow cases. Keldor started vacuuming, but the poor thing overheared and refused to restart.

I had asked on Friday on the local FB group about companies or individuals in the area doing house cleaning, and remembered today to check for replies. As a result Rizza and Sture dropped by to have a look and discuss what I want. They will try a cleaning session tomorrow, and then we will decide if we want to make it a regular thing. Luckily, they have a functioning vacuum they can bring tomorrow. 

Then I tried buying a new vacuum and gave up.

Now I have done my yoga and only need to put the bed back together and brush my teeth before I can sleep
