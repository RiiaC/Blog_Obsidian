Worked from home. By 10:00 I felt super sleepy,  so I took my "friskvårdstimme" And did a whole hour workout. Then lunch, and back to work. 

After work we finally tested casting in the axe mould I made (we only finished making the plug last night). 

It took a few trys to get it to work perfectly. While the form is intended to be a bronze axe  we did the test in pewter, because, easier.  

Things I have learned doing this project:
- next time, do more prep work to prepare the mould blanks before starting on the carving.
   - both blocks should be the exact same size, instead of "ish"
   - the surfaces that get pushed together should be properly planar, so that they come completely into contact 
- ​the idea of putting ducttape over the surfaces that should not be carved was a good one, do that again, make the surface to be taped smooth first
- next time, use better stone. Those little inclusions of pyrrotite really interfere with carving the detail decorations 
- took Keldor’s work car to Höstdansen, as mine is waiting for both service and a warming light dealt with, abd his is waiting for him to have time to fix it
- Keldor’s old friend A. attended! Her first SCA event in ~20 years. She quit during a messy divorce that included her ex burning all her SCA costumes etc.  She had fun!
- started a nålbinded bag for Ragnhild's water jug from yarn Ranghild brought, as it wss too dark in the room to sew my tunic in the evenings
