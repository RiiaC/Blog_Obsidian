I slept 7.5 hours and woke before Keldor was showing as online, so I thought I had time for a 25 minutes workout before he was up. Nope, about 12 minutes in to the session he called, so I paused, enjoyed his company for about 40 minutes, and then finished with an hour and a half to spare before tome to meet P. & R. for breakfast which is enough to both repack the backpack with just what is needed for today's workshop and take a nap. Except, I didn't fall asleep, so I ordered a replacement tea tree oil toothpaste, which should reach my home around the same time I do.

The highlight of my workday was the surprise of meeting Björn, an SCA friend at the workshop, who now works for Riksantikvarieämbetet. Neither of us expected to see the other. 

The workshop mainly focused on K-samsök 
https://www.raa.se/hitta-information/k-samsok/ and the way have set up the data models for it, which are similar to those used by LinkedArt https://linked.art/, with a few differences because K-samsök has as its focus all Cultural Heritage, which has a strong archaeological compent  and so the straight art-based model of LinkedArt isn't quite a perfect match. 

However, one thing they share with LinkedArt is the extra layer of abstraction: a book isn't about something. A book is a physical object having a specific physical dimensions and form, made of specific materials at a certain time, using a specific process. Written on its pages is a body of text, which has properties of language, meaning, plot or subject matter, word count, style etc. That same text can exist in a variety of different forms of books, or in one or more digital formats, each with their own properties of file size, format, date of creation, etc. 

By doing it this way it is easier to link together all the different editions of the same text, no matter if it a hand written manuscript, a printed book, a pgn facsimile, a pdf, or what. By including subject matter as one of the properties one can find all texts, or paintings or photographs that have the same subject matter.

Needless to say, a project like K-samsök which aggregates search results from multiple museums, government and university databases, art galleries etc. Have a lot of work going on behind the scenes to ensure that each information source is using appropriate metadata for their information to ensure that the user will be able to find the information they want.

They also showed us some of the 3D models in the Lund Digital Archaeology Lab
https://www.darklab.lu.se/digital-collections/dynamic-collections/. I had seen it once before, but hadn't understood how one can turn on and off various layers. I will look forward to playing with it later.

After the workshop I met up with Torunn. We walked over to the nearest grocery store. Bough some food, including some strawberries, grown in Uppsala.we didn't expect strawberries to be available this late in the season, and didn't expect them to be that yummy.

We ate sitting on a stone in a park, overlooking the water that flows into the harbour. Then we went for a long walk, stopping at the hotel to leave my backpack and use a toilet, and also going past the grocery store to pick up her bike pump she had set down when putting the food in a bag.

It was good to have the time to catch up with her, and nicely cleared out my brain after such an information filled workshop. 

Then I had time for a quick call with Keldor before he slept. We discussed our friend Bryan's request to go to the open house for the house for sale around the corner from us. His bos is seriously considering his request to switch to being a contractor, so he would count as a business owner, and thus be able to apply for a Swedish visa on a different track than the normal "I got a job offer" route. Therefore, if we don't see any problems with the house he is considering making an offer.

We are both willing to go to the viewing, which is tomorrow from 17:00 to 18:00. However, Keldor works tomorrow at Boliden, 100 km from home. He should be done in time to get back on tome for the viewing, but we can't be certain.  Likewise, my flight lands in Umeå at 15:30 (if on time), which might be possible to make the 16:05 bus, which would get me to the viewing at 17:30. But if I instead have to take the 16:20 bus, i wouldn't be in Lövånger till 18:05. Therefore I emailed the realator and let them know that I would try, but might be late, and would they be willing to wait? Yes, they would.

Then I did my evening yoga and went to bed. Well, I may have looked at FB for a bit before sleeping...
