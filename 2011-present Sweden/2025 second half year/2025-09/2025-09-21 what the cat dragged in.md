Remembered that I once put my 2016 workouts from Frej on Trello, and decided to start them from the beginning, with the warmup, https://trello.com/c/ucqCk97f and workout 1 https://trello.com/c/yT4K9ehx. It took 38 minutes total. I had forgotten about rocking plank on elbows, with feet in the jungle gym. I like that one! I did it with my elbow on the piano bench, so I didn't have to adjust the height. It has been too long since I did that headstand sequence! Even with bent legs it was hard to do the first set and the second I couldn't do the last one at all.

Went to Þórólfr's birthday party today. On the way there we stopped by Jula to buy a wooden box the same size as we already have for feast gear, which we will modify to fit the chamber pot I bought yesterday. 

At the party I started sewing my new silk tunic. I think I will like it. After the main crowd thinned down to few enough to fit at the table we played a game of Flux, followed by Cards Against Humanity. 

Then home and packed the sewing into the backpack for tomorrow. Now there is time for a quick game of Qwirkle before yoga and bed.

Ewww... on the way to the bedroom I found a worm, a normal garden worm, on the floor. The cats must have brought it in to play with and then gotten bored. Keldor, who has handled hundreds of worms in a lifetime of fishing picked it up, wuth his bare fingers, and carried it outside, and reported that it was still alive. Poor thing. I hope it makes better life choices going forward than crawling into the cat enclosure.
