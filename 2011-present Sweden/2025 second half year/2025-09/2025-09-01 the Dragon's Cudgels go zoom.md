Started the day by riding to Skelleftehamn with Keldor, as his car was still there from Friday. Picked up the spare monitor I have there because I used to work there sometimes, and it has been ages since last I did (definitely before I started working at UmU).

Then home and worked right up to time for the first zoom gathering of the Dragon's Cudgels, where we had enough to start our first go through of a play. This project is to do talk throughs of some translated plays that haven't been performed since the 1500's to see how they go, and what needs fixing to make then useable for a theater troupe. If this sounds fun, and you aren't already in contact with Jay about this, let me know and I will introduce you. He has groups in most time zones.

As I was finishing my work day Keldor went to the treadmill for a 20 minute run as he wants to get into the sort of shape that makes fighting in Crown fun before the tournament that will happen in seven months.

I am in favour of improved shape, so after my zoom call I did a 20minute session with the DownDog High Intensity Training app.
