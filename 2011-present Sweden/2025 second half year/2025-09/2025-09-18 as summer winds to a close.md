Busy work day with several meetings. 

Learned something important about Obsidian. If one tires dragging a file into the program to make a link to the file, it kinda looks like it worked. However, what has happened is that one has made a copy of that file, in the folder that the other Obsidian files live in. This can cause problems later if you edit that file, and then later open the original file and wonder what happened to the data. It turns out that to get a true link to the original file and not a copy one needs to hold down Cntrl whislt dragging the file into the Obsidian note. I am unlikely to forget this.

After work we started some wintersing of the yard, including putting the canoe up on its stand, up against the side of the house, taking down the modern sunshade that we have had up since being given it this spring, and which I never got around to using because we weren't home much this summer. He also mowed some of the lawn. It might be the last time those parts need doing this year.
