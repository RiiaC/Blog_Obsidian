Only 5 hours of sleep, but woke with Keldor’s first alarm anyway. So I had time to read the note from my sister Amber, whose poor old dog, Gryphon, went in to have his teeth cleaned, but the x-rays showed that half of them needed to be removed. Poor thing.

**Goal for today**: test the new food dehydrator, which arrived last night, on the apples from his dad's tree. 

Managed to accomplish that just before doing my evening yoga and heading to bed.
