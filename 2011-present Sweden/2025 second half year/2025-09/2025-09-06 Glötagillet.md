Woke 07:30, decided that since it was 1.5 hours later than I normally take my morning vitamins I should try to find something to eat and take them. If I had put a banana in reach  I could have just taken them with a bit or two and went back to sleep. Since I didn't I got dressed and went downstairs. Only Gudrun (evrnt steward) was awake, starting breakfast. So I found some crackers and ate a couple with my vitamins, then helped clean the kitchen from the late night food prep.

Gudrun went to town to buy more food, and Askatla took over food prep, so I did a quick 10 minutes pilates, after which more people were awake and the porridge was ready.
