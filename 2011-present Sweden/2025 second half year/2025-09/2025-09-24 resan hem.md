Slept six hours, hung out with Keldor as he drove to Boliden, then had breakfast with colleagues before checking out of the hotel. 

Today's meeting focused on what needs to happen to make the information in the SEAD database searchable in K-samsök. 

Then R and I took a pleasant walk in the sunny, but cool weather to the Arlanda express train station,  and on to the airport. 

We got there in good time, had an uneventful flight home, where I took a taxi to the bus station on time to catch the 16:05 bus home, which left a few minutes late.

It finally made it to Lövånger at 17:40. Keldor picked me up at the bus station and we went directly to the open house on  the corner to look at it for Bryan.  It is a larger, nicer house than mine, with an amazing shop. Apparently, the late husband of the current owner had been an electrician, and that space was his business.  

After looking through the house twice (filming on the second lap through) we did a video call with Bryan to do a report. He sounds like he will make an offer, so we may well be neighbours if all goes well.
