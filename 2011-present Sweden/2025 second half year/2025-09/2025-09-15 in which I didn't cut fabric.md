- thought about cutting a silk tunic for me. Realised that I really need to pin the fabric to the carpet so I can mark it for cutting, and the new vacuum won't arrive till tomorrow.
- instead looked at the heavy orange silk, which may do for Keldor's new smithy tunic. Did a paper mockup, and then it was time for yoga and bed.
