We slept at Keldor’s dad's last night, arriving after he had gone to sleep, so we just went straight upstairs,  showed Clara to her room, I did my yoga while Keldor found sheets for her bed and for ours. Then I slept more than eight hours,  which doesn’t happen often.

When we got up Keldor helped his dad with computer stuff and window cleaning while Clara and I walked to the store to get breakfast, and then cut the sleves for her new tunic (we had cut the body and neck the other day). 

Then it was time to head to Reengarda's craft afternoon,  where I made progress on my silk tunic I cut out a couple of weeks ago, she sewed down the neck facing and started attaching the sleeves, and Keldor talked to people. Petronilla, Virya, Odal, and Jonas were all there today. A lovely time.

Then home, stopping on the way i  Vallen to pick up the now cooled metal. 

We baked a pound cake, beause pound cake. Played some Qwirkle, which Clara won, which pleased her mightily, given how much she had lost by the previous two games.

Then we looked at a youtube smithing video, and noticed that a message had come on from the Boar Hunt event team asking for folk to fill in a google form about our archery experience, so they know how to split us into groups at the event.

This triggered Keldor to check the bows he is bringing for he, Holmfrid and I, which made me think that it would be smart to have a bag to transport them in. So I tiok some of the fabric the couch was shipped in, and used Keldor’s sewing machine to sew it into a tube, and started to sew channels in it to make individual pockets for each bow. But then the machine started doing that thing with tons of extra thread on the underside. So I gave up and cleaned ot all away.

I went to do my yoga, and we noticed that there may be Northern Lights out, so we went for a look. Yes, very faint but there. Lots of stars, too. A beautiful night, with a very cold breeze.

Then I took time to type this, and now I really sgould do that yoga and get to sleep, it is getting late.
