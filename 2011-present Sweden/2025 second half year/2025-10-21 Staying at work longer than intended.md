We got eight hours of sleep! This is easy to accomplish when one is so tried from the road trip that one goes to bed before 21:00. I am now feeling much better, and think my brain is back on line.

I went in to the office today, since the weekly meeting happens on Tuesdays at 15:00. This week I was lucky! In the weekly meeting today they only talked about something that has nothing to do with me. So at 15:27 I asked "will we discuss anything else today? If not, maybe I can take the early bus, I feel like I don't have anything to contribute to the meeting". They said goodbye, and I went to the bus stop next to my office, and the bus came pretty much straight away. 

Ironically, once on the bus I got so absorbed working I didn't notice when the bus got to Lövånger. Note, the bus turns left off the highway, then right into the parking lot, then left to pull up to the building, then, if one doesn't get off, it turns left to continue through the parking lot, then left onto the street, then right to get back onto the highway. This is the only stop on the route with so many turns, and I noticed none of them. 

Several minutes later I looked up, wondered when we would be there, didn't see any landmarks that gave me a hint, looked at the time, noticed it was 7 minutes after we should have arrived. Opened google maps, and saw that we were, in fact a few minutes north of Lövånger. Oops.

Pressed the stop button, called Keldor, who had just driven past where I was. Grabbed everything, got off the bus, he turned around, came and picked me up.

In hindsight, a factor could have been the weekend's long toad trip. My bus commute to work is only 1.5 hours, which after Sunday's 22 hours, feels really short!
