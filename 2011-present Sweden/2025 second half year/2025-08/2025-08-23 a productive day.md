Oops, forgot my second set of vitamins yesterday afternoon. Second time this has happened. 

For first time in several days, the cats left a tiny bit in the bowl, so I could water it with a mix of the last of the sauce in the bag plus warm water, so the food wouldn't dry out. The watering the left overs is our normal procedure, and, often, they go back later and finish the food. Sometimes they just drink the water, and, if I notice, I water it again. Usually the food either dissappears before the next morning, or it dries out and will never be eaten. On the days it dissappears early, if they ask for more after work they usually get a second bowl, which gets the same watering treatment, and which often dissappears before breakfast time (if it didn't dry out). Sometimes the second breakfast (as we call the occasional serving of soft food after work) doesn't completely dissappear before breakfast the next morning. On those mornings, they won't get a second breakfast after work, though they do get snacks. (So the extra meals get tied to days where one or both of them were hungry enough to eat everything the day before, though if it wasn't eaten because it dried out, we assume they were hungry enough and still get second breakfast, as drying out is on us). 

Since getting home from Lofoten they have been cleaning their plates at first serving, even when they ask for second breakfast (which is most, if not all, of this week). Today is the first day we are back ro the previous "normal" Of leave a little. I guess they have now had enough second breakfast days in a row to feel like they are well enough feed to leave something again? 

...and mid afternoon Skaði came back and ate up what was left, and then they both asked for second breakfast an hour or so later, which they devoured directly. We may have become a twice a day wet food for the cats family. 

Today was otherwise a productive, but easily distracted day. We unloaded the lumber he'd brought hone yesterday, and started cleaning the garage, so we can bring it in.

This lead to the first distraction. His running treadmill was moved to the garage months ago, with the plan to build an under base for it to compensate for the slope of the garage floor.

Today we decided to move it to the downstairs guest room, where the floor doesn't slope. So we rearranged the furniture in that room, stood the treadmill on end (it is designed to do that, and hung the rowing machine on the wall). We moved the desk dresser full of fishing gear to in front of the window, where, if anyone wants to open it and use umit as a desk, there will be better light, and the big dresser on the wall holding shut the door to the laundry room.

As we finished with the guest room and returned to the garage we found distraction number two. The table he built to take to events was also in garage, and should be in the attic now that camping season is over and we will be sleeping indoors at events.

Carrying it up reminded us that he'd cut that plexiglass to fix the broken attic window. The one that broke some time before we bought the house, and which someone had shoved a mastress in it to keep the snow out. Keldor had cut some plate metal the right size to screw over the window frame the first week or so after we got the keys, and for a little more than 3.5  years that end of the attic has been dark. I mean, yah, we had run an extension cord and a lamp back there, but it didn't help as much as one might like.

So today we cleaned and organised that end of the attic, took down the window frame, took off the metal, and screwed the plexiglass in place and put the window back. My, it lets in a Lot of light!

By then I was getting really hungry, so I took a "break" and made a quick pot of soup, with homemade noodles. Yum! Amd curled up with a book. Then Keldor fell asleep on the couch, and I decided to bake some scones. Because I am nice I woke him when they came out of the oven.

I had thought to return to working, but he voted for watching Snowwhite, so I made progress nålbindning his socks instead.  Now I feel tired, so time for yoga and bed.
