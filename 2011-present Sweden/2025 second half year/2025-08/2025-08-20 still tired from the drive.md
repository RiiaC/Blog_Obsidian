Busy day at work. During one meeting a colleague noticed that I use Obsidian, and we happily geeked out about it.

I also had a meeting with someone at Skellefteå kommun, who let me know what rules currently apply for the home improvement projects I have been dreaming of (carport and bicycle shed, a back door and a deck) and the fact that the rules may change with the new year, as the government is considering a proposal to make renovation easier.

Then we had a Shire meeting, during which I finally started actually inserting the photos I took during my inventory of Reengarda stuff in the storage unit. The timing is good, as it was only this week that Obsidian added the new Bases core plugin that turns the vault into a database, with the option to display the contents as cards with a cover photo, if one sets up an images property that contains a link to the relavant photo. This meant that I could do that step as I put the photos in. I am too tired now to put the photos of the result somewhere that I could share in Dreamwidth,  but you can look at them in the Readme file I created for the inventory https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ITQGLQ2hCTRnt9Sn3uhHdJQIpj_VBF5j017mU2b3xXY/edit?usp=sharing

Now I really need to do my yoga and get to sleep!
