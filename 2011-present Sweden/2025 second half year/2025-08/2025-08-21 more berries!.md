Yesterday Phil, one of my colleagues told me that they have more red currants than they need, and do I want to come pick some? Yes, yes indeed!

Since we had a working meeting after lunch today we decided that I would head home with him directly after the meeting, pick berries, and he'd drop me at the bus station after.

This is exactly what we did. They have only one red currant bush, but it is very prolific! I was there 45 minutes, and didn't quite empty the bush! They also have one black currant bush, that they will keep the berries of, and a white currant bush, which he gave me (he picked the white, while I picked the red).

Then I caught the 18:00 buss 100 north. That one doesn't stop in Lövånger, as it is an express bus to Haparanda, so Keldor drove down to Sikeå to pick me up at 19:00, which meant I was home at 19:30.

I am too tired to start drying the berries tonight, so I sm going to bed early (it isn't 20:30 yet). Tomorrow I will work from home.
