I worked from home today, so decided to try setting up a work station in the kitchen for easier reading of the screen (I forgot my new computer glasses in the office on Friday, and they are probably not set up to use the recliner and look up at the monitor anyway. So I unscrewed my monitor from the moving desk in the living room and took it to the kitchen, and found my old external keyboard, in the cupboard where "away" said it would be). sadly, the usb slot in the keyboard doesn't have enough power to run the Wacom tablet, so that has to stay attached to the computer itself, which meant that I had to unplug the hearing-aid Bluetooth thing to attach the keyboard to the computer. (This monitor has no USB slots, perhaps it is time to buy a better one?)  I plugged that into the keyboard, but I am concerned that future me will forget to move it back to the computer, so I made a note and attached it to the usb.
During an early break I started a batch of bread dough, with plenty of chunks of garlic in it, and let it rise as I worked, baking it in a bunch of small flat loaves with little pockets of soft roasted garlic, and plenty of garlic brushed over the outside of the loaves before, during, and after baking. Yum!

After work I had the energy to steam a bunch of vegetables I bought yesterday, and make a yummy sauce for them made from peanut butter, boiled garlic, melted butter, soysauce, chili, ginger, etc.

I got my cooking mess cleaned up before Keldor got home. He'd bern given som venison from one of hos colleagues who had hunted it a couple of days ago, so he stopped on the way home to pick up some chanterelle, and at the store to buy some cream and rutabaga. He put most of the meat into smaller bags in the freezer, then cooked up a stew with the other ingredients he brought home, plus som canned tomato and beans.

So we are clearly both recovered from the Norway trip, and once again doing things like cooking.
