Since the event had started on Thursday, but neither of us asked for Friday off of work, (having only just returned from three weeks in Norway, which used up most what was left of our vacation time) we didn't head to site till Friday after work. 

The event already being in full swing, we didn't try to drive down the small tack to the site (which they discourage people driving on all the time, but certainly not during an event).

However, when we were at the Shire storage unit on the way to the event to pick up archery targets, we also grabbed the collapsible modern canvas wagon.  This made it much easier to take everything down the hill.

This was Keldor’s first time sdeeing the Larp village, and he was suitability impressed. It is such a cozy site, with a number of cozy timber houses. No electricity and firelight help that feeling.

We played games. The musicians played music. I danced. There was lots of singing. Good food. Delightful people. 100% recommended.
