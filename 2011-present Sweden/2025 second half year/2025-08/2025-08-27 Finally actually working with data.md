Some mornings 05:20 feels earlier than others, and 6 hours of sleep doesn't feel like enough...
Luckily, it was an interesting day at work, so I managed to stay awake. I had a 9:00 fika with my former colleagues with the research data group at the library, followed with a meeting of the Radiocarbon Isotope Data task group for SEAD.  We went over the various data files we got from the Radiocarbon Isotope researchers who are looking to get their data into our database and looked at a variety of available tools for dealing with data and cleaning it up before ingestion into a database. The meeting ended with me taking on the assignment of figuring out the locations of the various sites listed in their spreadsheet. The researchers must have geographical coordinates somewhere, as the spreadsheet includes a copy of their figure 1, showing the locations on a map. However, neither that paper, nor any of the others I could find in the citation chain provided any location details. Therefore, I did the easy thing and sent an email to the author. 
After work I tried mailing back to the museum the pot handel I accidentally brought home from Lofoten with me. But the guy couldn't make it trackable, so I didn't send it.

Now it isn't even 19:00, and I am super tired, and I have done my yoga for the day, so I am seriously considering just heading to bed directly after posting this.
