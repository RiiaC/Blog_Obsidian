- [ ] Add measurements to Corel Draw for the tape marked areas on the floor of the potential pantry! determine how many meters worth of floor space each option provides to help in deciding

I got nearly 8.5 hours of sleep last night, and could have slept more, but I got up with Keldor at 5:30 nonetheless. We had our normal half hour call as he drove to work, and then I sat down to the computer for work. Yay! Working from home!

I had an 08:00 zoom meeting, looked into travel options for the work trip to Stockholm next month, took a nap. Actually booked the flights and hotel, emptied my inbox, and suddenly the work day was over.

Then I measured the second hand door we bought, marked the wall with tape to show where it would go if we install it in the space next to the wall that currently seperates the kitchen from the small room next to it. Then also marked the floor with tape showing the latgest size pantry that could go in the corner between the space for the door and the corner,  and between the window on the other wall and the corner, assuming the shelves on the outer wall are 18 cm wide, and the entrance to the pantry is on the corner, 45 degrees to both walls.

That pantry space looked small to me (I grew up in a house with a pantry so big there was a big stand in freezer in the smaller end of the space), and if we did then change that way then the piano would have no where to go.

If I made the pantry longer, long enough for the piano to fit against its outer wall, I like the pantry space better. However, thst would mean I would have to take our the wall and wall of cabinets that I have wanted gone since I bought the house.

I like this idea, so I spent some hours at the computer drawing up that idea. Meanwhile, Keldor stayed after work to tale apart some very large pallets that he thinks would be good for some of our projects.

He started driving home around the time I finished with the computer, and we chatted on the phone while I tidied up in the kitchen and started cleaning the red currants I picked yesterday and getting them into the dehydrator. 

Keldor got home as I was nearing done with that task, and I showed him my drawings,  and he commented that he had been thinking of a pantry even smaller than the smaller of the two I had marked with tspe on the floor. His version is a square i stead of a rectangle. 

He also reminded me of his concerns about taking out that wall. We don't know if it is load bearing, if it goes we need to replace both flooring and ceiling. All valid concerns. 

The load bearing part got me to check the kommune's web page to see if there are any architectural plans for this house in file available for download. Nope. So I filled in the form to order some, if they exist.
