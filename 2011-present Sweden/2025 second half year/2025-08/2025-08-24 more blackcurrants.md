Last night while watching the movie my legs started cramping up. I was also super tired, so I did my yoga, and then lay on the ccouch with my legs on the rotating ball massage tool till it turned itself off. Around that time Keldor came back upstairs to say that he'd returned to the garage to continue what we had started earlier, and now he'd moved the long table that came with the house aeay from the wall, moved the safe into the corner where it had been,  and the secong hand old fashioned carpenter's bench we bought not long before heading to Norway against the wall. 
I felt bad that I had been too tired to even notice that he'd gone downstairs, let alone help, and super impressed he managed to move that heavy safe.

I got up the first time today at 05:30, fed the cats, did a load if laundry and got the dried red currants out of the dehydrator and started the white currants drying.  Then I went back to sleep for a couple of hours (I don't think Keldor even noticed I had been up).

We started our day with a game of Qwirkle, then added the weather stripping around a couple of windows, that should have been done ages ago. The others will have to wait till we get more.

Then he went out to pick chanterelle, and I curled up with a book, then delt with some Exchequer paperwork, and finally went out to see how many black currants our bushes have this year 7 bushes between them yielded a good handful of berries (they are clearly starting to think about forgiving us for transplanting them, but aren't really ready to do any serious berry production).

So I hopped in the car are drove to the place a couple of km on the other side of the highway where there area bunch of black currant bushes, and picked for an hour or so,which gave me enough to fill the five trays of my dehydrator. Hopefully I will get back out there at least once more this year.
