Worked from home, so also baked bread rolls and did a couple loads of laundry. 

Finished sketches of how the attic looks now, and what I want to do with an upstairs bedroom and half bath, and sent it to the contractor who visited last Wednesday. 

In the evening I finished the right half of my sweater alteration in progress, and cut the left side and started sewing it.

Then Keldor and I did acroyoga for the first time since August  and only the 10th time all year. The problem with my right forearm seems to have cleared up enough to manage it again. Much to my surprise, we managed the transition from bird to me in bow pose still balenced on my hips on his upraised feet. That used to be almost impossible even when Johan and I were meeting for acroyoga 3 to 5 days a week, and tonight it felt quite reasonable.

As it is now:
