We are on our way south towards the Boar Hunt event, and we managed to leave the house early enough that we made it to Skuleberget before dark, which meant we had time to go up the hill to the old sea cave, which, ~8000 years ago was right on the coast. I love this hike!

However, coming back down wearing progressive glasses as twilight approaces meant that downhill took way longer than I remember it talking last time. 

The reason we got on the road so early was that Keldor took the day off to fix the roof. When we cleaned out half the attic last week to get ready to insulate a room up there we noticed light coming in near the wall.

So yesterday we bought a long enough ladder and this morning, as I worked, he moved enough of the ceramic roof tiles to expose the hole, put tar paper over it, and replaced the tiles.

He says that it all looks like sometime in the next five years we should take off all the tiles, re-tar paper the whole thing (replacing any boards that need it, and then put up a new roof, quite possibly solar panels). Of course, that will mean not spending that summer travelling to all the events.

We drove south as far as The Realm of Krake, arriving 23:something, and found them both hard at work in the workshop using the lasers to print stuff for an upcoming Exhibition.

We chatted with them briefly and then retired to their guest house to sleep for the night.
