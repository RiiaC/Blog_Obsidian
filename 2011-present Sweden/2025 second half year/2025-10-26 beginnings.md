Today we began making progress on the attic room: started putting up the horizontal boards between the uprights to which the tarpaper will attach before we insulate. There are still a few more that need to be cut to length and put into place before we can start on the tar paper step.

In the evening Clara and I started step 1 of making handels for the knives we made two weeks ago in the smithy at Vallen.
