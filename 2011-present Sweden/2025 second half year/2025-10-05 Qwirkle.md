We opened the new box of Qwirkle today. Shiny and new! We had bought it a wee were closing in on our 200th game, as the old tiles were starting to get a little worn. But then we said that we should give them a coat of clear spray point so the colour lasts longer, and that never happened, and we kept playing with the old set, till we discovered a tile missing last night. No idea how long it has been missing, but late game he "knew" I had a purple square, because he had the other piece needed to make a Qwirkle in a row of four. Then I went out without playing it. So we organised all the tiles by colour and shape to confirm that it is only the one tile missing. Presumably it fell to the floor and the cats played with it, and we didn't notice. 

This evening sat down with Þórólfr and he showed me how to do the income declaration for the shire. Then he exported the full year of bank transactions to an Excel file, which made it much easier to reconcile the account.
