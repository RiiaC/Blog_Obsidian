Oops, we had turned off the dawnlight Friday night as we could sleep in on Saturday, and forgot to turn it back on. So when Keldor’s alarm went off today, the room was dark, and we were both sleeping deeply. We managed to get up anyway, but it wasn't as easy as a normal day, when that gradual light increase slowly wakes us.
During my lunch break I finally remembered to bring in the hose. I still need to use the compressor to blow out the water, but at least it won't freeze when the nighttime temps drop those last couple of degrees. 
Despite taking a nap mid day, I still managed to put in a full work day, if perhaps not the most productive ever.
Keldor took the knives we made to work and used power tools to clean up the blades.
