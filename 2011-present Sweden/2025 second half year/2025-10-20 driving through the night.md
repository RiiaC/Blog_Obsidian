We reached the rest area at Tönnebro at 0:37, and aftera 20 minutes break for toilet and a brief stretch I took over driving for the first time all trip. I refilled my water bottle with a little Vitamin Well Awake and a lot of water, put a single piece of candy in my mouth to slowly dissolve, and the Swedish version of Anne of Greengables audio book in my hearing aids. Keldor took a pillow and leaned himself against the passenger door to sleep, and Clara put sleeping music in her headphones and relaxed in the middle seat.

I managed 1.5 hours of driving before my water bottle was empty, my bladder full, and at 02:20 we had reached  [Fardäng's runestone](https://kvikr.se/finn/php/finn-click.php?id=runkartan&target=https%3A%2F%2Frunkartan.se%2Frunristningar%2Frunsten-burestenen-m1-l1935-2750-njurunda-116-1-i-sundsvall-vasternorrland.html)  We stopped, of course, to show Clara that stone, having told her of how he used that runestone as documentation for his SCA name. However, at that hour, there wasn't any point in stopping by to say hello, so after a selfie taken by car headlights and emptying my bladder in a grassy area that wasn't in the headlights, Keldor took over driving, and I curled up with the pillow against the passenger door.

I slept a hour, till my bladder woke me, luckily just before the High Coast bridge, so we could stop at the  rest area there. After he started driving I didn't fall straight back to sleep, so I took the chance to update my logs 
till my bladder woke me and demanded a rest stop. 

After that Keldor gave me back the car, and I managed to drive most of the way to Ånäset before I needed to pee  so he took back over and we went to the package pick up place in Ånäset, arriving at 07:19, which, given that they open at 07:00 was very good timing.

We reached home at 07:45, 22 hiurs and 8 minutes after leaving site. We only brought in the pillows and ice chest, which we emptied into the fridge and freezer (the wild boar meat he picked up in Vadstena was happily still frozen).

Then we slept 4 hours before gettin up for breakfast and a quick game of Qwirkle (despite missing one QwirkleI could have had, I still won). I am so glad we were smart enough to take today as a vacation/recovery day. I am not certain I could brain well enough to work today.

We did manage to empty the car and put the big stuff away, cook some food, and we even played a game of Qwirkle, but other than that it has been mostly sitting on the couch.
