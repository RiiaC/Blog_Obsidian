Today I managed to re-gather all of the documents needed to get access to the shire bank account as kassör (treasurer/exchequer). The same information we sent them in August which they never got. Now I just need to get signatures from all the other relavant shire members and we can try sending it in again.

Work was very productive, getting lots done, including finally finishing SEAD's Data Management Plan. It was also a long day, so I have enough hours ahead for the week I can work a short day on Friday. 

Keldor took another training day today, wearing his chainmail to work all day, and then keeping it on for mushroom picking on the way home. Ironically, wearing armour didn't protect him from the small snake he never saw. At least we assume that the bruise on the end of his little finger (left hand), with two tiny prick marks in it are a snake bite. He didn't notice it till he got home. How do you not notice getting bitten by a snake?
