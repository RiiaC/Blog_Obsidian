I decided to work from Skelleftehamn today, so that I will be able to return the new personal computer I had bought as soon as the shop opens (ok, as soon as I finish my meeting, which starts when the shop opens). 

Why? In part because I didn't much like the propensity of Windows 11 to do things for me without asking consent first. In part because my home Wacom pen and tablet is too old to work with that type of processor (it literally wouldn't install the driver that works with that pen/tablet, as the "platform isn't supported"), but the straw that really made It easy to decide not to keep it was when I tried to copy over the documents folder from the old computer, and it wouldn't fit. Therefore, it wouldn't be possible to install any programs, either. Nope, just nope. I will take it back, and put off buying a new one till after we get back from Boar Hunt.

> linux distribution on a modern usb stick, to try it on the computer and see if I like it.

After work we went to buy a ladder to fix the roof on the house, and then to the Museum for a lecture. [Järnframställning i Norrbotten](https://skelleftea.se/invanare/arkiv/evenemangskalender/evenemang/2025-09-03-jarn-i-norr---forntida-staltillverkning-bland-jagar--och-samlargrupper-i-arktiska-europa)

# Järn i norr
## Forntida stålverkning bland jägar- och samlargruppar i Arktiska Europa 
### Carina Bennerhag
- Carina's new research on how it spread and passed on to new generations.
- Iron work in north 2000 år sedan 
- laste for Archaeologists to notice because still hunter gathering here
- Sangis 200 år f.c. stål verk

Vivungi
Found slag in two places on the beach

![[2025-10-15_2 grävning.jpg]]
Then found more concentrated slag, iron, and furnace. All 2000 år gammal 

Then wen back and looked at old collections 

![[2025-10-15_3 slag.jpg]]

![[2025-10-15_4 för och nu.jpg]]


C14 dates work on steel!
![[2025-10-15_5 experiments.jpg]]
Even earlier date from Arvidsjaur, same age as middle east early finds
![[2025-10-15_6 old slag.jpg]]
Methods

![[2025-10-15_7 methods.jpg]]
High carbon steel, high quality 
![[2025-10-15_8 Vivungi.jpg]]
Roman ore high Mn. So is ours. 
0,8%


![[2025-10-15_9 experiment.jpg]]

As found:

Need to trade off for ___ hours, keep tempo

Jarnlump
![[2025-10-15_14 hot bloom.jpg]]
Små fragmenter ramlar. Det hittade vi.

Quality steel 
Felra steg. Behändlet och förbättra 
![[2025-10-15_15 artefacts.jpg]]
Holkyxa av stål
Knife edge harder
Temperature blended ovanligt, but we did it
Clearly knew what they were doing

Multiple metals in one slag:
![[2025-10-15_16 med koppar.jpg]]

Lodning
Plätering
Decorative 

Needs control, small temperature windows

We only have slage evidence, here, so far

Bronze plated spear

![[2025-10-15_17 bronze plated.jpg]]

Many stages
![[2025-10-15_18 all the steps.jpg]]
Collect

Climate matters, some of this is seasonal

Summer:
![[2025-10-15_19 organisation.jpg]]

Dry trees 1 2 seasons before coal

Take lera to place in winter?

Small communites

Probably collective work

Water also had fish 
![[2025-10-15_20 with fishing.jpg]]

Ore 1.5 to 4 m djup can be very near shore

![[2025-10-15_21 close map.jpg]]
Chewed bits of dried fish found


![[2025-10-15_22 fortsatt forskning.jpg]]
Used to think settled in winter and nomad in summer

But iron smelting needs more in place in summer

Well developed technique,  no trace of experimental stage 

Already advanced 300 BC. How so quick spread? That is current focus of research 




Went back to this photo
- [ ] find the better version and fix record

So much iron needed per farm, so we produced enough in one place for ___ farms

Requires a system to keep the knowledge and pass it to next generation 

There is trace of bronze work in north but no one has researched the other metals, yet

Phosphorus iron also found here

80 kg malm i Sangis 


There are likely more production places unfound
Asbestos ceramic, from that period. If it is there, analysera the slag
